## Tools

[AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is a unified command line tool to manage your AWS (Amazon Web Services) services.

[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes.

[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. Also, API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

[AWS Chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice) is a framework for writing serverless apps in python. It allows you to quickly create and deploy applications that use AWS Lambda.

[Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration for Amazon Aurora (For MySQL & PostgreSQL editions), where the database will automatically start up, shut down, and scale capacity up or down based on the user's application needs.

[AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings. 

[AWS SAM CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli) is a CLI tool to build, test, debug, and deploy Serverless applications using AWS SAM.

[AWS Copilot](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/copilot/) is a command line interface (CLI) that enables customers to quickly launch and easily manage containerized applications on AWS. 

[Serverless Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vendia/serverless-express) is a library that runs serverless applications and REST APIs using your existing Node.js application framework, on top of AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.

[Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com/) is a serverless deployment platform for Laravel, powered by AWS.

[Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong) is a Cloud-Native API Gateway.

[faasd](https://openfaas.com/blog/introducing-faasd/) is a project similar to [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/), but without the cost and complexity of Kubernetes. It runs on a single host with very modest requirements, making it fast and easy to manage. Under the hood it uses [containerd](https://containerd.io/) and [Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) along with the same core OpenFaaS components from the main project.
